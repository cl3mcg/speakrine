## Features

- **Periodic RSS Feed Fetching**: Fetches RSS feeds at regular intervals (every 20 minutes).
- **HTML Content Cleaning**: Cleans HTML content from RSS feed items to ensure only plain text is stored.
- **Database Integration**: Stores fetched and cleaned RSS data in a MySQL database.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses environment variables for configuration, including database credentials and Mistral AI API key.

## Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file and fill in the required values.
All environment variables are required and should be provided as strings.

```env
DB_HOST=your_db_host
DB_PORT=your_db_port
DB_DATABASE=your_db_name
DB_USERNAME=your_db_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key
MISTRAL_MODEL_TINY=your_mistral_model_tiny
MISTRAL_MODEL_MEDIUM=your_mistral_model_medium
FETCH_INTERVAL=rss_feed_fetch_time_interval_in_minutes
```

## Usage

The application runs in two main processes:

1. **Fetching RSS Feeds**: Periodically fetches RSS feed data and stores it in the database.
2. **Cleaning RSS Data**: Cleans the HTML content from the fetched RSS data and updates the database with the cleaned content.

The main process is defined in `main.go`, which initializes a ticker to run the fetching and cleaning processes every 20 minutes.
